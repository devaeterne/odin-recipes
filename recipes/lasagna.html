    <h3>Tuna Tartare</h3>
    <p>No one knows the precise origins of this recipe, but in Sicily it is true that tuna fishing is a genuine tradition.

        The nets used to catch the Mediterranean red tuna are very famous in Sicily; some of them have become virtual museums over time, and with the decline in their use.
        
        Tuna has lean, dense flesh; its natural flavour, with the scent of the sea, combines beautifully with the sweet and acidic notes of Sicilian citrus.
        
        The fragrances of land and sea combine in a simple but very elegant dish. Here is the recipe for citrusy tuna tartare!</p>
